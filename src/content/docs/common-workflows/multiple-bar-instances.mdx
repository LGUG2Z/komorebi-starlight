description: How to launch multiple instances of komorebi-bar
---

If you would like to run multiple instances of `komorebi-bar` to target different monitors, it is possible to do so by maintaining multiple `komorebi.bar.json` configuration files and specifying their paths in your configuration file.

You may also use or `$KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME` when specifying the paths.

```json
{
  "bar_configurations": [
    "$KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME/komorebi.bar.monitor1.json",
    "$KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME/komorebi.bar.monitor2.json"
  ]
}
```

The main difference between different `komorebi.bar.json` files will be the value of `monitor.index` which is used to target the monitor for each instance of `komorebi-bar`.
