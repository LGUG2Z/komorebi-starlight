description: How to set a custom configuration directory
---

You can specify a custom configuration directory by setting the `KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable.

If you already have configuration files that you wish to keep, move them to the directory specified by the `KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable.

You may reference `$KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME` in various options of the configuration when giving file paths, for example:

```json
{
  "app_specific_configuration_path": "$KOMOREBI_CONFIG_HOME/applications.json"
}
```
