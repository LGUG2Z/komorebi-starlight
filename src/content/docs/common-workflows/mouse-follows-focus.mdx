description: How to disable mouse follows focus
---

By default, the mouse will move to the center of the window when the focus is changed in a given direction. This behaviour is know as 'mouse follows focus'. This behaviour can be disabled in the `komorebi.json` configuration file.

```json
{
  "mouse_follows_focus": false,
}
```
