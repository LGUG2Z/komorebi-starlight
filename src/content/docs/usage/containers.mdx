## Container Stacks

Container stacks can be manipulated in the following ways.

### Stacking

#### Directional Stacking

The focused window can be stacked on top of another window in a relative direction using the <PlatformLink command="stack" /> command.

#### Consolidation

All windows on a workspace can be consolidated into a single stack using the <PlatformLink command="stack-all" /> command.

### Focus

The focused window at the top of a container stack can be cycled using the <PlatformLink command="cycle-stack" /> command.

### Unstacking

#### Single Windows

The focused window at the top of a container stack can be popped into an independent container using the <PlatformLink command="unstack" /> command.

#### All Windows

All windows in a stack can be split into independent containers using the <PlatformLink command="unstack-all" /> command.

## Monocle Containers

A container can be set as the monocle container, hiding all other containers on the workspace, by using the <PlatformLink command="toggle-monocle" /> command. This command is reversible.
