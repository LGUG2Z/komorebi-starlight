## Focus

Monitors can be focused in the following ways.

### By Index

Monitors can be focused by index using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="focus-monitor"/> command, or by a mixture of monitor index and workspace index using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="focus-monitor-workspace"/> command.

### Cycle Direction

Monitors can be focused in a cyclic direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-monitor" /> command.

### By Cursor

Monitors can be focused by cursor position using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="focus-monitor-at-cursor"/> command.

## Boundary Behaviour

### Cross Boundary Behaviour

There are two behaviours which can be configured when an action on a window container would cross a monitor boundary:

* <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="crossboundarybehaviour" text="Workspace"/> - attempts to perform the action across a workspace boundary on the same monitor
* <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="crossboundarybehaviour" text="Monitor"/> - attempts to perform the action across a monitor boundary

### Cross Monitor Move Behaviour

There are three behaviours which can be configured when attempting to move a window across a monitor boundary:

* <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="movebehaviour" text="Swap"/> the window container with the window container at the edge of the adjacent monitor
* <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="movebehaviour" text="Insert"/> the window container into the focused workspace on the adjacent monitor
* <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="movebehaviour" text="NoOp"/> (do nothing) if trying to move a window container in the direction of an adjacent monitor

This behaviour can be changed in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cross-monitor-move-behaviour"/> command.
