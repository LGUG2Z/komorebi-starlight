## Focus

Windows can be focused in the following ways.

### Relative Direction

Windows can be focused in a relative direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="focus"/> command.

### Cycle Direction

Windows can be focused in a cyclic direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-focus" /> command.

### Largest Tile

The window at the largest tile can be focused using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="promote-focus" /> command.

### Eager focus

It is possible to attempt to focus the first window on any workspace matching an executable name using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="eager-focus" /> command.

## Movement on a Workspace

Windows can be moved in the following ways.

### Relative Direction

Windows can be moved in a relative direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="move"/> command.

### Cycle Direction

Windows can be moved in a cyclic direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-move" /> command.

### Largest Tile

Windows can be moved to the largest tile using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="promote-swap" /> command. This command is reversible.

## Movement Across Workspaces

The commands covering movement of windows across workspaces in komorebi come in two flavors:

- `move` - these commands move the focused window to a target workspace and then focus the target workspace
- `send` - these commands move the focused window to a target workspace while remaining on the currently focused workspace

### By Workspace Index

The focused window can be moved or sent to a workspace on the focused monitor identified by an index using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="move-to-workspace"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="send-to-workspace"/> commands respectively.

### Cycle Direction

The focused window can be moved or sent to a workspace on the focused monitor in a cyclic direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-move-to-workspace"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-send-to-workspace"/> commands respectively.

### By Monitor and Workspace Index

The focused window can be moved or sent to a workspace on a specific monitor identified by monitor and workspace indicies using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="move-to-monitor-workspace"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="send-to-monitor-workspace"/> commands respectively.

### By Name

The focused window can be moved or sent to a workspace in a monitor-agnostic manner by name using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="move-to-named-workspace"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="send-to-named-workspace"/> commands respectively.

### By Last Workspace

The focused window can be moved or sent to a last focused workspace on the focused monitor using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="move-to-last-workspace"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="send-to-last-workspace"/> commands respectively.

## Movement Across Monitors

### By Monitor Index

The focused window can be moved or sent the focused workspace at a monitor identified by index using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="move-to-monitor"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="send-to-monitor"/> commands respectively.

### Cycle Direction

The focused window can be moved or sent to the focused workspace of a monitor in a cyclic direction using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-move-to-monitor"/> and <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-send-to-monitor"/> commands respectively.
