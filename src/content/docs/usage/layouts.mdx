## Layout Selection

<KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="defaultlayout" text="Layouts"/> are selected using the <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout" text="layout configuration option"/> for each workspace and can be pre-configured as <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout_flip" text="layout_flip" text="flipped on specific axis"/>.

Certain layouts have <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout_options" text="options"/> which adjust how they arrange containers on a workspace.

The layout for the focused workspace switched in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="change-layout"/> command.

The layout for the focused workspace can be cycled in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-layout"/> command.

The layout for the a workspace identified by monitor and workspace index can be set in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="workspace-layout"/> command.

The layout for the a workspace by name can be set in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="named-workspace-layout"/> command.

## Layout Rules

<KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout_rules" text="Layout rules"/> are used to automatically change the layout on a specified workspace when a threshold of window containers is met.

```json
{
  "monitors": [
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "workspace with layout rules",
          "layout_rules": {
            "1": "BSP",
            "4": "UltrawideVerticalStack",
            "7": "Grid"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the above example
* When there are between 1 and 3 window containers on the workspace, the BSP layout will be applied
* When there are between 4 and 6 window containers on the workspace, the UltrawideVerticalStack layout will be applied
* When there are between 7 or more window containers on the workspace, the Grid layout will be applied

Layout rules can be cleared from a workspace by monitor and workspace index using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="clear-workspace-layout-rules"/> command, and by workspace name using the <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="clear-named-workspace-layout-rules"/> command.

## Layout Ratios

<KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="layoutoptions" text="Layout options" /> can be used to define custom split ratios for various layouts.

BSP layout with default 50/50 splits

![Before layout ratios](../../../assets/layout-ratios_before.png)

BSP layout with `column_ratios: [0.7]` and `row_ratios: [0.6]`:

![After layout ratios](../../../assets/layout-ratios_after.png)

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "monitors": [
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "main",
          "layout_options": {
            "column_ratios": [0.3, 0.4],
            "row_ratios": [0.4, 0.3]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can specify up to 5 ratio values (defined by `MAX_RATIOS` constant). Each value should be between 0.1 and 0.9
(defined by `MIN_RATIO` and `MAX_RATIO` constants). Values outside this range are automatically clamped.
Columns or rows without a specified ratio will share the remaining space equally.

### Usage by Layout

| Layout | `column_ratios` | `row_ratios` |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Columns** | Width of each column | - |
| **Rows** | - | Height of each row |
| **Grid** | Width of each column (rows are equal height) | - |
| **BSP** | `[0]` as horizontal split ratio | `[0]` as vertical split ratio |
| **VerticalStack** | `[0]` as primary column width | Stack row heights |
| **RightMainVerticalStack** | `[0]` as primary column width | Stack row heights |
| **HorizontalStack** | Stack column widths | `[0]` as primary row height |
| **UltrawideVerticalStack** | `[0]` center, `[1]` left column | Tertiary stack row heights |

### Examples

#### Columns Layout with Custom Widths

Create 3 columns with 30%, 40%, and 30% widths:

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "column_ratios": [0.3, 0.4]
  }
}
```

:::note
The third column automatically gets the remaining 30%
:::

#### Rows Layout with Custom Heights

Create 3 rows with 20%, 50%, and 30% heights:

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "row_ratios": [0.2, 0.5]
  }
}
```

:::note
The third column automatically gets the remaining 30%
:::

#### Grid Layout with Custom Column Widths

Grid with custom column widths (rows within each column are always equal height):

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "column_ratios": [0.4, 0.6]
  }
}
```

:::note
The Grid layout only supports `column_ratios`. Rows within each column are always divided equally because the number of rows per column varies dynamically based on window count
:::

#### VerticalStack with Custom Ratios

Primary column takes 60% width, and the stack rows are split 30%/70%:

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "column_ratios": [0.6],
    "row_ratios": [0.3]
  }
}
```

:::note
The second row automatically gets the remaining 70%
:::

#### HorizontalStack with Custom Ratios

Primary row takes 70% height, and the stack columns are split 40%/60%:

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "row_ratios": [0.7],
    "column_ratios": [0.4]
  }
}
```

:::note
The second column automatically gets the remaining 60%
:::

#### UltrawideVerticalStack with Custom Ratios

Center column at 50%, left column at 25% (remaining 25% goes to tertiary stack),
with tertiary rows split 40%/60%:

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "column_ratios": [0.5, 0.25],
    "row_ratios": [0.4]
  }
}
```

:::note
The second row automatically gets the remaining 60%
:::

#### BSP Layout with Custom Split Ratios

Use separate ratios for horizontal (left/right) and vertical (top/bottom) splits:

```json
{
  "layout_options": {
    "column_ratios": [0.6],
    "row_ratios": [0.3]
  }
}
```

- `column_ratios[0]`: Controls all horizontal splits (left window gets 60%, right gets 40%)
- `row_ratios[0]`: Controls all vertical splits (top window gets 30%, bottom gets 70%)

:::note
BSP only uses the first value (`[0]`) from each ratio array. This single ratio is applied consistently to all splits of that type throughout the layout. Additional values in the arrays are ignored
:::

### Progressive Ratio Behavior

Ratios are applied progressively as windows are added. For example, with `row_ratios: [0.3, 0.5]` in a VerticalStack:

| Windows in Stack | Row Heights |
|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | 100% |
| 2 | 30%, 70% (remainder) |
| 3 | 30%, 50%, 20% (remainder) |
| 4 | 30%, 50%, 10%, 10% (remainder split equally) |
| 5 | 30%, 50%, 6.67%, 6.67%, 6.67% |

### Automatic Ratio Truncation

When ratios sum to 100% (or more), they are automatically truncated at config load time.

For example, if you configure `column_ratios: [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]` (sums to 100%), the last ratio (0.3) is automatically removed, resulting in effectively `[0.4, 0.3]`. This ensures there's always remaining space for the last window.

| Configured Ratios | Effective Ratios | Reason |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| `[0.3, 0.4]` | `[0.3, 0.4]` | Sum is 0.7, below 1.0 |
| `[0.4, 0.3, 0.3]` | `[0.4, 0.3]` | Sum would be 1.0, last ratio truncated |
| `[0.5, 0.5]` | `[0.5]` | Sum would be 1.0, last ratio truncated |
| `[0.6, 0.5]` | `[0.6]` | Sum would exceed 1.0, last ratio truncated |

This ensures the layout always fills 100% of the available space and new windows are never placed outside the visible area.

### Notes

- Ratios are clamped between 0.1 and 0.9 (prevents zero-sized windows and ensures space for other windows)
- Default ratio is 0.5 (50%) when not specified, except for UltrawideVerticalStack secondary column which defaults to 0.25 (25%)
- Ratios are applied **progressively** - a ratio is only used when there are more windows to place after the current one
- The **last window always takes the remaining space**, regardless of defined ratios
- **Ratios that would sum to 100% or more are automatically truncated** at config load time to ensure there's always space for additional windows
- Unspecified ratios default to sharing the remaining space equally
- You only need to specify the ratios you want to customize; trailing values can be omitted
