## Layout Selection

<KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="defaultlayout" text="Layouts"/> are selected using the <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout" text="layout configuration option"/> for each workspace and can be pre-configured as <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout_flip" text="layout_flip" text="flipped on specific axis"/>.

Certain layouts have <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout_options" text="options"/> which adjust how they arrange containers on a workspace.

The layout for the focused workspace switched in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="change-layout"/> command.

The layout for the focused workspace can be cycled in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="cycle-layout"/> command.

The layout for the a workspace identified by monitor and workspace index can be set in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="workspace-layout"/> command.

The layout for the a workspace by name can be set in realtime using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="named-workspace-layout"/> command.

## Layout Rules

<KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="workspaceconfig-layout_rules" text="Layout rules"/> are used to automatically change the layout on a specified workspace when a threshold of window containers is met.

```json
{
  "monitors": [
    {
      "workspaces": [
        {
          "name": "workspace with layout rules",
          "layout_rules": {
            "1": "BSP",
            "4": "UltrawideVerticalStack",
            "7": "Grid"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the above example
* When there are between 1 and 3 window containers on the workspace, the BSP layout will be applied
* When there are between 4 and 6 window containers on the workspace, the UltrawideVerticalStack layout will be applied
* When there are between 7 or more window containers on the workspace, the Grid layout will be applied

Layout rules can be cleared from a workspace by monitor and workspace index using the <KomorebicPlatformLink command="clear-workspace-layout-rules"/> command, and by workspace name using the <KomorebiConfigPlatformLink command="clear-named-workspace-layout-rules"/> command.
