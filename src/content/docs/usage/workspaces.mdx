## Focus

Workspaces can be focused in the following ways.

### By Index

Workspaces can be focused by index on the focused monitor using the <PlatformLink command="focus-workspace"/> command, or by a mixture of monitor index and workspace index using the <PlatformLink command="focus-monitor-workspace"/> command.

### By Name

Workspaces can be focused in a monitor-agnostic manner by name using the <PlatformLink command="focus-named-workspace"/> command. All of your workspaces should have unique names. If two workspaces have the same name, the first match in the window manager state will be focused.

### By Last Workspace

The last focused workspace on the focused monitor can be focused using the <PlatformLink command="focus-last-workspace"/> command.

### Across Multiple Monitors

Workspaces can be focused by index across all monitors using the <PlatformLink command="focus-workspaces"/> command. This will focus the same workspace index on all monitors simultaneously, giving the feeling of a workspaces which span all monitors.

## Movement

Workspaces can be moved to other monitors in the following ways.

### By Focus and Index

The focused workspace can be moved to a monitor identified by an index using the <PlatformLink command="move-workspace-to-monitor"/> command.
