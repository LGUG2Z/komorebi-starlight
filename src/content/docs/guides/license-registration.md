komorebi [identifies corporate devices](https://lgug2z.com/articles/normalize-identifying-corporate-devices-in-your-software/) [on a best-effort
basis](https://lobste.rs/s/vd7dgj/normalize_identifying_corporate) through the
detection of mobile device management enrollment.

## License Registration

If you are using komorebi on a device enrolled in mobile device management, you
will receive a pop-up when you run `komorebic start` reminding you that the
[Komorebi License](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-license) does not permit
any kind of commercial use.

You can remove this pop-up by running `komorebic license <email>` with the email
associated with your Individual Commercial Use License. A single HTTP request
will be sent with the given email address to verify license validity.

## Students on Windows Machines

If you have an device provided by your educational institution, or a personal
device which you have been forced to enroll in "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD)
MDM, you can email me (my_github_username _at_ fastmail _dot_ com) from the
address associated with your institution with the subject "komorebi - student
with an MDM device", and I will be able to remove the splash intended for
corporate users

This is currently a manual process - most days this shouldn't take more than
12h, and you will receive an email reply from me when the process is complete.

If you haven't had a reply to your email within 24h you can reach out to me on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/mGkn66PHkx).
