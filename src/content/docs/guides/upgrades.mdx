import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Before upgrading, ensure that komorebi and the komorebi bar have been stopped.

```bash title="Stop komorebi and komorebi bar"
komorebic stop --bar
```

Once the processes have been stopped, you can upgrade komorebi using your
package manager.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="Scoop">
    ```bash title="Upgrade komorebi"
    scoop update komorebi
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="WinGet">
    ```bash title="Upgrade komorebi"
    winget upgrade LGUG2Z.komorebi
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Homebrew">
    ```bash title="Upgrade komorebi"
    brew update
    brew upgrade lgug2z/tap/komorebi-for-mac
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Homebrew (nightly)">
    ```bash title="Upgrade komorebi"
    brew update
    brew upgrade lgug2z/tap/komorebi-for-mac-nightly
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the upgrade is completed you can confirm that you have the latest version
by running `komorebic --version`, and then start it with `komorebic start --whkd --bar`.
