Tiling window managers in general are very complex pieces of software.

In an attempt to reduce some of the initial configuration burden for users who
are looking to try out the software for the first time, example configurations
are provided and updated whenever appropriate.

Run the following command to download example configuration files for
komorebi, whkd (on Windows) and skhd (on macOS).

Pay attention to the output of the command to see where the example files have
been downloaded.

```shell title="Install the example configurations"
komorebic quickstart
```

:::note[macOS Permissions]
The `quickstart` command will also prompt you to grant komorebi and the terminal
emulator you are start komorebi with the permissions it requires to run, and
will open the following System Settings tabs for you:

* Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility
* Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Screen & System Audio Recording

komorebi will not run unless it has the required permissions.

## Starting komorebi

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    With the example configurations downloaded, you can now start `komorebi`,
    `komorebi-bar` and `whkd`.

    ```bash title="Start komorebi, komorebi-bar and whkd in the background"
    komorebic start --whkd --bar
    ```

    If you decide you don't like the komorebi-bar and want to use a different bar,
    you can kill the bar, and next time you start komorebi, omit the `--bar` flag.

    ```bash title="Kill the komorebi-bar and start komorebi without it"
    komorebic kill --bar
    komorebic start --whkd
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS">
    With the example configurations downloaded, you can now start `komorebi`,
    `komorebi-bar` and `skhd`.

    ```bash title="Start komorebi, komorebi-bar in the background"
    komorebic start --bar
    ```

    ```bash title="Start skhd in the foreground"
    skhd --config ~/.config/komorebi/skhdrc
    ```


    If you decide you don't like the komorebi-bar and want to use a different bar,
    you can kill the bar, and next time you start komorebi, omit the `--bar` flag.

    ```bash title="Kill the komorebi-bar and start komorebi without it"
    pkill komorebi-bar
    komorebic start
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
