## The Software

komorebi exists first and foremost to address my own needs, and as such it is built primarily according to my personal preferences; I don't care if i3 does something this way, or hyprland does something that way - komorebi will always do things my way.

komorebi is built on top of limited public APIs exposed by closed operating systems - it will likely never be as flashy as the window managers and desktop environments you will find on Linux.

I work on komorebi and provide support to users in my own time, at my own pace.

komorebi is not an open source project and I am not an open source software developer, so you should check any remnants of the open source culture of dehumanizing software maintainers at the door when you enter any komorebi community spaces.

This also applies if you have purchased an Individual Commercial Use License; you have purchased a license to use the software for commercial use _in the current state and as it is provided_. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Contributions

There have been a number of contributors to komorebi over the years, and contributions are accepted under the [Zero-Clause BSD License](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/bsd-0-clause-license).

However, these days I am quite conservative when it comes to accepting contributions from new contributors due to the scale and scope of the project, the ubiquity and questionable quality of LLM-generated code, and the potential blast radius for breaking changes.

If you would like to contribute code to the project, please speak to me first on Discord in the `#development` channel instead of opening a drive-by PR.

## Support

Support is provided on a best-effort basis by myself and other volunteers in the community.

A lot of effort has gone into automatically generating correct and up-to-date documentation for komorebi's configuration schema and komorebic's CLI commands.

Providing support is by far the most time-consuming aspect of this project, so please make sure you exhaust all of the available documentation resources first _before_ reaching out to the community for support.

This means doing basic things like:

- Following the quickstart guides when you install the software
- Ensuring your configuration files contain valid JSON
- Validating your configurations against the provided JSONSchema files
- Searching through komorebic commands and reading the usage documentation

If and when you do reach out to the community for support, please be kind, be patient, and be respectful.
