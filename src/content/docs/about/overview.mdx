komorebi is an educational source cross-platform tiling window manager for
Windows and macOS.

komorebi allows you to control application windows, virtual workspaces and
display monitors with a CLI which can be used with any hotkey software.

komorebi aims to make *as few modifications as possible* to the operating
system and desktop environment by default.

## Design

komorebi only responds to operating system events and the messages it receives on a
dedicated socket.

komorebic is a CLI that writes messages on komorebi's socket.

komorebi doesn't handle any keyboard or mouse inputs directly.

This architecture, popularised by [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm)
on Linux and [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) on macOS, is outlined
as follows:

```
               PROCESS                SOCKET
hotkey daemon  -------->  komorebic  <------>  komorebi
```

## Data Model

komorebi holds a list of physical monitors.

A monitor is a rectangle of the available work area which contains one or more
virtual workspaces.

A workspace holds a list of containers.

A container is a rectangle where one or more application windows can be
displayed.

This means that:

* Every monitor has its own collection of virtual workspaces
* Workspaces only know about containers and their dimensions, not about
  individual application windows
* Every application window must belong to a container, even if that container
  only contains one application window
* Many application windows can be stacked and cycled through in the same
  container within a workspace
