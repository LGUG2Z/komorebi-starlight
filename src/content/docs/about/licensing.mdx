description: About the Komorebi License
---

komorebi is [educational source
software](https://lgug2z.com/articles/educational-source-software/).

## Personal Use

komorebi is licensed under the [Komorebi 2.0.0
license](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-license), which is a fork of the
[PolyForm Strict 1.0.0
license](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/strict/1.0.0).

On a high level this means that you are free to do whatever you want with
komorebi for personal use other than redistribution, or distribution of new
works (i.e. hard-forks) based on the software.

Anyone is free to make their own fork of komorebi with changes intended either
for personal use or for integration back upstream via pull requests.

## Commercial Use

A dedicated Individual Commercial Use License is available for those who want to
use komorebi at work.

The Individual Commerical Use License adds “Commercial Use” as a “Permitted Use”
for the licensed individual only, for the duration of a valid paid license
subscription only.

All provisions and restrictions enumerated in the [Komorebi
License](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-license) continue to apply.

More information, pricing and purchase links for Individual Commercial Use
Licenses [can be found here](https://lgug2z.com/software/komorebi).

Many employers reimburse software licensing costs, so submit a reimbursement
request to your employer with your receipt(s).

With mainstream corporate software reimbursement policies, the Individual
Commercial Use License functions as a mechanism to empower end users to mediate
corporate contributions to the financial sustainability of independent software.
