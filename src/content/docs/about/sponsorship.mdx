komorebi is an [educational
source](https://lgug2z.com/articles/educational-source-software/) project, and
one that encourages you to make charitable donations if you find the software to
be useful and have the financial means.

I encourage you to make a charitable donation to the [Palestine Children's
Relief Fund](https://pcrf1.app.neoncrm.com/forms/gaza-recovery), the [Sameer
Project](https://chuffed.org/project/149178-sameer-project-x-mass-displacement-campaign)
or to contribute to a [Gaza Funds campaign](https://gazafunds.com) before you
consider sponsoring me on GitHub.
