There is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGkn66PHkx) available for
komorebi-related discussion, help, troubleshooting etc.

The Discord server includes the popular [Rice Rice
Baby](https://discord.com/channels/898554690126630914/1260648062158897284) forum
for users to share their desktops and configurations.

There is a [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeai3-do-9O4MNy9_xjO6mg) where I post
komorebi development videos, feature previews and release overviews.

Subscribing to the channel (which is monetized as part of the YouTube Partner
Program) and watching videos is a simple and passive way to contribute
financially to the project.

There is an [Awesome List](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/awesome-komorebi) which
showcases the many awesome projects that exist in the komorebi ecosystem.
